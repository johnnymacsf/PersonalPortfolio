Lab Project for my Systems Programming course. 
SICXE Dissassembler that reads and parses SIC/XE object code and prints out the details of each instruction of the object code. 
The first part of this program gets each instruction in the text record of the object code, extracting the mnemonic instruction,
the instruction's format, the operand addressing type, the target address addressing mode, and the object code. 
The second part of this program first parses the object code file for the header, text, and modification records. 
It then parses a second file, test.sym, for the symbol and literal tables and getting, if they exist, the symbol label information and
the constants and literals information. 
Finally, after parsing all of this information it then outputs the assembly code into the output file, out.lst.
