BlackJack game made in Python, played through the console. 
Planned second iteration of this code using a GUI later 
Rules:
Player is dealt two cards, which are printed out to the console, the first card for the dealer is revealed while the second is "face down." 
The player than has the choice of either hitting in hopes of getting to or closer to 21 (total when adding up the card values) or standing (staying).
If the player goes over 21, they bust (lose). If not, the dealer has a chance to beat or equal the player's card total.
